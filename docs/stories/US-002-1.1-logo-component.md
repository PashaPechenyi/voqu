# US-002-1.1: Logo Component

## Story

**As a** visitor
**I want to** see a recognizable logo throughout the site
**So that** I can identify the brand and navigate to the home page

---

## Description

Create a reusable Logo component that displays the Voqu brand mark. The component should support multiple sizes for use in different contexts (header, footer, marketing materials).

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create Logo component at `apps/web/src/components/common/Logo.tsx`
- [ ] Display a School icon from MUI Icons alongside "Voqu" text
- [ ] Support three size variants: small, medium, large
- [ ] Default to medium size if no prop provided
- [ ] Icon and text should use primary color from theme
- [ ] Icon and text should be horizontally aligned with proper spacing
- [ ] Component should accept size prop with TypeScript type safety
- [ ] Text should use bold font weight (700)

---

## Technical Notes

**Library:**
- `@mui/material` - Stack, Typography components
- `@mui/icons-material` - School icon

**File location:** `apps/web/src/components/common/Logo.tsx`

**Size specifications:**
| Size | Icon | Text |
|------|------|------|
| small | 24px | 1.25rem |
| medium | 32px | 1.5rem |
| large | 48px | 2rem |

**Component props interface:**
```typescript
interface LogoProps {
  size?: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large';
}
```

---

## UI/UX Requirements

- Icon and text should appear as a cohesive unit
- Use MUI Stack for horizontal layout with spacing={1}
- Color should match primary theme color
- Should be clickable when wrapped in a Link (parent handles this)

---

## Notes

- Keep the component simple and focused
- No click handling - parent components will wrap in Link if needed
- Consider adding aria-label for accessibility when used as navigation
