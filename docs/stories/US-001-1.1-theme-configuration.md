# US-001-1.1: Theme Configuration

## Story

**As a** developer
**I want to** set up a centralized MUI theme configuration
**So that** all UI components have consistent styling across the application

---

## Description

Create the MUI theme configuration file that defines brand colors, typography settings, and component style overrides. This theme will be used throughout the entire application to ensure visual consistency.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create theme file at `apps/web/src/theme/index.ts`
- [ ] Define primary color palette (blue tones: main #2563eb)
- [ ] Define secondary color palette (purple tones: main #7c3aed)
- [ ] Define success, warning, and error colors
- [ ] Configure background colors (default white, paper white)
- [ ] Configure text colors (primary #1e293b, secondary #64748b)
- [ ] Set up typography with Inter font family as primary
- [ ] Configure font weights for heading variants (h1: 700, h2: 600, h3: 600, h6: 600)
- [ ] Set default border radius to 8px
- [ ] Override MuiButton: remove text transform, set fontWeight 600, remove box shadows
- [ ] Override MuiAppBar: set white background
- [ ] Export theme for use in ThemeProvider

## Technical Notes

**Library:** `@mui/material` - use `createTheme` function

**File location:** `apps/web/src/theme/index.ts`

**Color palette:**
| Color | Value | Usage |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Primary main | #2563eb | Main interactive elements |
| Primary light | #3b82f6 | Hover states |
| Primary dark | #1d4ed8 | Active states |
| Secondary main | #7c3aed | Accent elements |
| Success | #22c55e | Positive feedback |
| Warning | #f59e0b | Caution indicators |
| Error | #ef4444 | Error states |

**Typography:**
- Font family: "Inter", "Roboto", "Helvetica", "Arial", sans-serif
- Headings should have heavier font weights
- Body text uses default weights

---

## Dependencies

Required packages (should already be installed):
- `@mui/material`
- `@emotion/react`
- `@emotion/styled`

---

## Notes

- This is a foundational story - must be completed before other UI components
- The theme follows a modern, clean design aesthetic
- Colors are chosen for good accessibility contrast
